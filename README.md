Simple Python Calculator
About the Project
This is a simple CLI Calculator written in Python. I created this project as part of my learning process while studying Python (inspired by Bro Code) to practice user input, data types, and conditional logic.

🧮 How It Works
The program:

Asks the user to enter two numbers.

Asks for an operator (choose between +, -, *, or /).

Uses IF statements to determine which mathematical operation to perform.

Prints the result of the calculation to the console.
